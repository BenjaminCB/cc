# Exercise 1
No, as we know a 2-tape TM can be simulated on a single tape TM, using te same principles we can simulate a 3-tape TM on a single tape TM.

# Exercise 2
No, we $w$ one cell to the right and add a symbol $v$ at the start of the tape, the state $q_v$ will then go left until it meets $v$.

A nondeterministic TM M is called a decider iff on any given input x all computation branches of M halt in $q_{accept}$ or $q_{reject}$.
