# Exercise 1
These are the same as for the class P.

# Exercise 2
There is an assumption that $f$ is computable in polynomial time, which is not the case.

# Exercise 3
1. $\{ \langle \phi \rangle | forall\ variable\ assignments\ I\ I \vDash \phi\}$
2. SAT is NP-complete we can reduce this problem to SAT by negation of $\phi$ which can clearly be done in polynomial time.
